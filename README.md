# Repository Description
In January 2024 I decided to pivot my career in more programming and engineering direction.
Since I want to work in the future in the field of Data Science and Machin Learning I decided to refresh and further develop my Python programming skills.
This repository contains simple Py programs that I built from scratch to learn and refresh the basics of the language.
